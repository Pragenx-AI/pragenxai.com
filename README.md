## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### 💬 Reusable Chat Architecture
The application now utilizes a centralized `ChatMessageList` component. This allows the dedicated GPT page and the new **Home Inline Chat** to share identical rendering logic, ensuring a consistent premium experience across the platform.

### 🔇 The Silence Guarantee
We've implemented a custom `silent` flag within our `ChatMessage` interface. 
- **Auto-Detection**: The `ChatInput` automatically marks text-based submissions as silent.
- **Smart Synthesis**: The `VoiceAssistant` component monitors the chat state and intelligently bypasses the Speech Synthesis API for any message marked as silent, ensuring a quiet search environment while maintaining full vocal capabilities for mic-initiated flows.

### 📐 Layout Intelligence
The `MainLayout` now features conditional rendering logic that manages the **Active Conversation** overlay. This overlay uses glassmorphism and smooth CSS transitions to provide a "picture-in-picture" chat experience that stays accessible while you navigate your dashboard.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling:** CSS3 (Vanilla + Tailwind for layout), Lucide Icons
- **APIs:** Web Speech API (Recognition & Synthesis)
- **State Management:** Custom React Context API (AppContext)
- **Navigation:** React Router DOM v6
