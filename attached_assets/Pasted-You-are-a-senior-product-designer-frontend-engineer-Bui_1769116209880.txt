You are a senior product designer + frontend engineer. Build a modern, futuristic, unique landing page for an AI product called “PRAGENX AI”.

References for vibe (not copying):
- aquadev.site → immersive sections, depth, smooth scroll feel, subtle parallax, fluid gradients
- metamusic.ca → premium futuristic minimalism, elegant typography, soft glow accents, cinematic transitions

Goal:
Make visitors instantly feel: “This understands my life problems — I need this.”
Primary conversion: email waitlist signup.
Secondary goals: trust (privacy), clear free vs premium, strong “proactive intelligence” differentiation.

Tech Requirements:
- Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- No heavy libraries; keep it fast
- Use Framer Motion for subtle animations and scroll reveals (lightweight usage)
- Must be mobile-first and fully responsive
- Must be accessible (good contrast, focus states, aria labels)
- Must include SEO (title, description, OpenGraph, favicon)
- Must have a working waitlist form with frontend validation and success/error toast
  - For now store email submissions in localStorage + console.log
  - Provide a clean place to later wire in Resend / API endpoint

Project Structure:
- /app/page.tsx (landing)
- /app/layout.tsx (global styles, metadata)
- /components/* (Navbar, Hero, Sections, Pricing, FAQ, Footer, Toast)
- /public/logo.png (I will upload the PRAGENX AI logo here)

Visual Style (must look premium + futuristic but not neon/crypto):
- Background: soft deep-charcoal gradient OR off-white + subtle noise texture (choose one cohesive theme)
- Use ONE accent color (electric blue/indigo) + optional subtle gold highlight
- Use glassmorphism sparingly (blur cards, soft border)
- Use large, elegant typography and generous whitespace
- Add subtle animated gradient orb(s) in background
- Add a refined grid overlay / starfield dots at low opacity (very minimal)
- Smooth section transitions and microinteractions

Landing Page Sections (must be in this order):
1) Sticky Navbar
   - Left: logo (from /public/logo.png) + “PRAGENX AI”
   - Links (anchors): Product, How it Works, Examples, Pricing, Privacy, FAQ
   - Primary CTA button: “Join Early Access”
   - Mobile hamburger menu with slide-down panel

2) Hero (full viewport, cinematic)
   - Headline: “An AI That Thinks Ahead for You.”
   - Subheading:
     “PRAGENX AI is a proactive personal assistant that predicts, reminds, and protects you from everyday stress — bills, meetings, travel, habits, and records.”
   - Email input + CTA “Join Early Access”
   - Microtrust: “Privacy-first. You control what Pragenx can access.”
   - Right side: futuristic “assistant console” mock (no screenshots needed)
     - Show 4 animated notification cards:
       • “EMI due in 3 days — risk detected”
       • “Two meetings overlap tomorrow at 3 PM”
       • “Trip in 5 days — rain expected Day 2”
       • “Water intake low — want reminders?”
   - Subtle motion: cards float gently, reveal on load, parallax on scroll (very subtle)

3) Problem Section
   - Title: “Life is busy. Your mind is overloaded.”
   - 6 pain cards:
     - Forgetting EMI & utility bills
     - Too many apps to manage life
     - Missed meetings & deadlines
     - No clear view of finances
     - Health habits slipping quietly
     - Stress from “what did I forget?”
   - Closing line: “Humans shouldn’t have to remember everything.”

4) Solution Section (“Why Pragenx AI”)
   - Title: “Meet Pragenx AI — Your Proactive Intelligence”
   - Comparison block:
     - Instead of: “Remind me to pay a bill”
     - Pragenx AI: “Your bill is due in 3 days, and your balance may fall short. Want help?”
   - Feature grid (6):
     Bills & EMI tracking, Smart reminders, Financial insights, Health nudges, Travel awareness, Meeting intelligence

5) How It Works (3 steps)
   - Connect (secure), Learn (patterns), Act (predict + alert)
   - Use icons and short copy (no jargon)
   - Animate step cards on scroll (Framer Motion)

6) Proactive Examples (notification gallery)
   - Display as interactive cards (hover expands)
   - Each has actions: “Fix now”, “Remind me”, “Dismiss”
   - Add a subtle “Premium” badge on predictive insights cards

7) Pricing (Free vs Premium)
   - Two-tier card layout + optional monthly/annual toggle (UI only)
   - Free:
     Basic chat, Manual reminders, Alarms, Limited history
   - Premium:
     Smart bill tracking, Predictive alerts, Financial insights, Health/habit intelligence, Monthly reports, Priority AI
   - Add gentle conversion nudge: “Upgrade when life gets serious.”

8) Privacy & Trust
   - Title: “Your Data. Your Control.”
   - Bullets:
     - No data selling
     - Permission-based connections
     - Clear deletion controls
     - Encryption where applicable
   - Add “Trust badges” style row (minimal)

9) FAQ
   - 6 questions with accordion interaction:
     - What is Pragenx AI?
     - What does it connect to?
     - Is my data safe?
     - What’s free vs premium?
     - When does early access launch?
     - Can I cancel anytime?

10) Final CTA
   - Title: “Stop remembering everything. Start living.”
   - Email input + button
   - Small line: “Be among the first to experience proactive AI.”

11) Footer
   - Links: About, Privacy, Terms, Contact, Social
   - Minimal, premium look

Functional Requirements:
- Smooth anchor scrolling
- Toast notifications:
  - On waitlist submit success: “You’re on the waitlist!”
  - On invalid email: “Please enter a valid email.”
- Form should not reload the page
- Use localStorage to store submitted emails (for demo)
- Add a clean placeholder function to later send to Resend API

Deliverables:
- Provide complete code (Next.js App Router)
- Ensure it runs on Replit with npm install + npm run dev
- Keep performance excellent (no huge images, no heavy libs)
- Ensure the UI looks futuristic and unique but trustworthy and minimal
